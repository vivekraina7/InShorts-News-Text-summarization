## Deep Learning Project: News Text Summarization using LSTM Neural Networks and Web Deployment

1. Developed a deep learning project to summarize news articles using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
2. Used Python programming language and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit to build the project.
3. Preprocessed and cleaned the news dataset, applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to prepare the text data for model training.
4. Trained an LSTM neural network on the prepared data and achieved high accuracy and performance in summarization.
5. Built a web app using Streamlit to deploy the model and enable users to input the news text to get a summary.
6. Tested the model and web app thoroughly to ensure accuracy and functionality.
7. Demonstrated strong skills in deep learning, NLP techniques, model training, and web app deployment.
8. This project can be used as a practical example of how deep learning techniques can be used to summarize large volumes of text data and deployed as web applications.
